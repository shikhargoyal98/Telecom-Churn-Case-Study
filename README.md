**Telecom Churn Prediction Case Study:**

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify high-risk customers who are likely to leave the service, allowing telecom companies to proactively take actions to retain them. The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Key Features:**

Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw telecom customer data for analysis.

Churn Prediction: Build machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Visualization: Visualize key trends and insights to better understand factors contributing to churn.

**Tools & Technologies:**

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Data Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
